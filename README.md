I am an applied scientist at IBM Research working at the intersection of representation learning and environmental science. I'm interested in machine learning, computer vision, and climate change. I have research experience in weather forecasting, air quality monitoring, precision agriculture, and remote sensing applications. My work has been featured on international venues such as [ICLR 2020](https://www.cv4gc.org/cv4a2020/), [Deep Learning Indaba 2018](https://deeplearningindaba.com/2020/), and [EGU 2018](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/EGU2018-19766.pdf).
